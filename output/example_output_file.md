Glyphosate, an age-old herbicide has now become an emerging concern to mankind because several case reports are there regarding the presence of this contaminant in different water resources along with its toxic metabolite, aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA). Furthermore, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) categorized glyphosate as "probably carcinogenic to humans" in 2015. In this scenario, a validated mass confirmatory method using the Agilent 6470 LC/TQ instrument has been developed to detect and quantify these contaminants at μg L-1 levels in water. The proposed method includes the usage of only one mL of the water sample, a 30-min derivatization step with 9-FMOC-Cl [(9H-Fluoren-9-yl)methyl carbonochloridate], and clean up with dichloromethane (DCM). The developed method is time-saving and less laborious than the conventional methods for the analysis of the contaminants in water. The method validation parameters, like linearity, selectivity, accuracy, and intermediate precision, are satisfactory. Method LOQ (Limit of quantification) for glyphosate-FMOC and AMPA-FMOC was 0.05 μg L-1 and 0.5 μg L-1, respectively. The method can be used for routine monitoring of glyphosate and AMPA residues at very low level in different kinds of water like drinking water, packaged drinking water, irrigation water etc.

Identifying patients with inherited colorectal cancer (CRC) syndromes offers many potential benefits. However, individuals often experience decisional conflict regarding genetic testing for CRC, and the uptake rate remains low. Given the growing popularity of genetic testing and the increasing demands on genetic service providers, strategies are needed to promote informed decision-making, increase genetic testing uptake among at-risk individuals, and ensure the rational use of genetic service resources. This study aims to determine whether a decision aid (DA) tool could promote informed decision-making among family members regarding the genetic testing of a patient with CRC. A single-center, parallel-group, randomized controlled trial was conducted. We randomized 82 family members of patients with CRC, who were involved in major medical decision-making for the patient, to either a DA intervention or usual care. The primary outcome was informed decision-making, assessed through measures of knowledge, decisional conflict, decision self-efficacy, and preparation for decision-making. Secondary outcomes included patients' uptake of genetic counseling and testing, participants' CRC screening behavior, healthy lifestyle scores, anxiety and depression levels, quality of life, and satisfaction with the intervention. Data were collected at baseline (T0), after the intervention (T1), and 3 months after the baseline survey (T2). The DA intervention and outcome assessments at T1 and T2 were delivered via WeChat. The effects of the intervention were analyzed using generalized estimating equation models. Statistically significant improvements were observed in knowledge (T1: β=2.049, P<.001; T2: β=3.317, P<.001), decisional conflict (T1: β=-11.660, P<.001; T2: β=-17.587, P<.001), and decision self-efficacy (T1: β=15.353, P<.001; T2: β=22.337, P<.001) in the DA group compared with the usual care group at both T1 and T2. Additionally, the DA group showed significantly greater improvement in processed and red meat intake (β=-1.494, P<.001) at T1 and in healthy lifestyle scores (β=1.073, P=.03) at T2. No differences were found between the groups for other outcomes. A DA tool may be a safe, effective, and resource-efficient approach to facilitate informed decision-making about genetic testing. However, the current DA tool requires optimization and further evaluation-for example, by leveraging more advanced technology than WeChat to develop a simpler and more intelligent DA system.

Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent cancers among women and significantly impacts psychological well-being and health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) during the perioperative period. Mobile health interventions offer a promising approach to providing education and psychosocial support, yet their effectiveness in this context remains underexplored. This study aimed to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of an innovative, mobile-based, perioperative care program for women undergoing breast cancer surgery (iCareBreast). The assessment focused on perioperative self-efficacy, anxiety, depression, fatigue, HR-QoL, and perioperative care satisfaction. A two-group randomized control trial was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Singapore. The intervention group used the iCareBreast app, offering four main resources: perioperative care guidance, breast cancer and surgery education, psychological support, and social support. The control group received standard hospital care. Participants in the intervention group engaged with the fully automated app daily for 29 days (two weeks before surgery, on the day of surgery, and two weeks after surgery). Data were collected face-to-face or on the web at three time points: baseline, immediately after the intervention (T1; two weeks after surgery), and at a 2.5-month follow-up (T2; three months after surgery). The primary outcome was perioperative care self-efficacy, while secondary outcomes included anxiety, depression, fatigue, HR-QoL, and perioperative care satisfaction. A total of 123 patients with early-stage breast cancer scheduled for breast surgery were enrolled in the study, with 62 patients assigned to the iCareBreast group and 61 patients to the control group. The results showed no significant differences between the groups in the primary outcome-perioperative self-efficacy-at any time point. Baseline scores were similar (P=.80), and while the iCareBreast group showed slightly lower scores at T1 (mean difference [MD] -1.63, 95% CI -3.43 to 0.18; P=.08) and T2 (MD -1.90, 95% CI -4.06 to 0.26; P=.09), the differences were not statistically significant. Similarly, secondary outcomes, including anxiety, depression, fatigue, HR-QoL, and perioperative care satisfaction, showed no significant changes between groups (all P>.05). However, the iCareBreast group reported higher perioperative care satisfaction during the postintervention assessment. Satisfaction scores were comparable at T1 (P=.68), while at T2, the iCareBreast group showed a slight increase compared to the control group (MD 0.35, 95% CI 0.04-0.73; P=.08), though the difference was not statistically significant. The mobile-based psychosocial intervention, although satisfied by users, did not demonstrate significant benefits compared to standard care. This highlights the need to refine the iCareBreast app in future iterations to enhance its effectiveness in addressing the targeted health outcomes. Future mobile health research should prioritize optimizing user engagement strategies and incorporating personalized approaches to better address the perioperative care needs of patients with breast cancer.

To compare demographics, clinical characteristics, health care resource utilization (HCRU), treatment duration, and overall survival (OS) with enzalutamide (ENZA) or abiraterone acetate (AA) in patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) in England. This retrospective study analyzed data from the Cancer Analysis System database on patients receiving ENZA or AA (January 2014-March 2020) for chemotherapy-naïve mCRPC (mCRPC was the only funded indication for ENZA/AA during study period). Baseline characteristics were assessed using standardized mean difference (SMD) (<0.1: balanced); differences were adjusted for using propensity score weighting (PSW). Cox proportional hazard models were used for OS and treatment duration. Number needed to treat was calculated from HCRU incidence rate ratios (IRRs). Overall, 8,485 patients were included (ENZA, 5,330; AA, 3,155). Diabetes mellitus was more prevalent in the ENZA group (SMD, 0.12) at treatment initiation. HCRU was comparable between groups before treatment initiation (SMD < 0.1), but HCRU IRR after treatment initiation favored ENZA. Compared with AA, ENZA was associated with significantly fewer inpatient stays, outpatient or accident and emergency (A&E) visits, and hospitalization days (P < .01), and significantly lower likelihood of treatment discontinuation (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.90 [95% CI, 0.86 to 0.96]; P < .01) and mortality risk (aHR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.87 to 0.98]; P = .010). Assuming 8 months' treatment and comparable groups through PSW, 1.9 inpatient admissions, 17.3 outpatient visits, 1.4 A&E visits, and 19.5 hospitalization days could be avoided per 10 patients on ENZA versus AA. Patients with mCRPC on ENZA or AA had generally similar baseline characteristics apart from diabetes prevalence. ENZA was associated with longer OS and treatment duration, and lower HCRU after treatment initiation than AA.

Cancer immunotherapies, such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, have advanced rapidly and achieved notable success, yet they face significant challenges due to poor response rates and immune-related adverse effects, particularly in cases of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). Photodynamic therapy (PDT) can initiate immunogenic cell death (ICD) by inducing endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of tumor immunotherapy. Herein, we develop potent PDT biomimetic liposomes (PB Lipo) locating the ER to realize a synergistic immuno-photodynamic treatment. The PB Lipo is prepared using the optimal ratios of the phospholipids in the ER membrane. It is then loaded with indocyanine green (ICG), a photosensitizer approved for clinical use. PB Lipo has the unique ability to accumulate in the ER via membrane fusion, leading to severe ER stress when exposed to near-infrared (NIR) laser light, thus intensifying ICD. In combination with the antiprogrammed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody (αPD-L1), PB Lipo significantly improves efficiency against tumors in xenograft TNBC models. As a result, our combined treatment enhances mature dendritic cells, activates CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells, and promotes the secretion of cytotoxic cytokines. Collectively, our findings reveal that PB Lipo-mediated PDT presents a viable approach for effectively targeting the ER and enhancing ICD, thereby boosting antitumor efficacy in TNBC.

Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common, aggressive, and dangerous lethal tumor in the brain, which develops in adults. Currently, the efficiency of chemotherapy treatment for GBM patients is still unsatisfactory. PW06 was synthesized by Dr. Lien's laboratory (China Medical University, Taichung, Taiwan), and it was demonstrated to induce cancer cell apoptosis in human pancreatic carcinoma MIA PaCa-2 cells. However, the anti-cancer activities of PW06 on human GBM cancer cells are not reported. Thus, herein, PW06 was investigated on the anticancer activity on human glioblastoma multiforme GBM 8401 cells. Both PI exclusion and Annexin V/PI double staining methods were conducted for investing cell viability and apoptosis in GBM 8401 cells, respectively; they were analyzed with flow cytometer assay. Results showed that PW06 decreased total viable cell number with the process of cell apoptosis in GBM 8401 cells. Both productions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+, affect mitochondria membrane potential (ΔΨm) levels, and activities of caspase-3, -8, and -9 in GBM 8401 cells after exposure with PW06 were assayed by flow cytometer. Results showed that PW06 promoted ROS production and Ca2+ release from ER but lowered the levels of ΔΨm, and it also induced higher activities in caspase-3, -8, and -9 in GBM 8401 cells. Evaluation of protein expressions associated with apoptosis in GBM 8401 cells after being incubated with PW06 were conducted by Western blot analysis. Results show that PW06 increased GADD153, BiP, ATF-6α, ATF-6β, eIF2α, eIF2αpSer51, CHOP, and caspase-4, and they are associated with ER stress-associated protein expression. However, it induced higher pro-apoptotic proteins (Bax and Bad) expression and inhibited anti-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, and Mcl-1) expression, even promoting higher cleaved caspase-8, -9, and -3 protein expression and increased EndoG and AIF in GBM 8401 cells. Collectively, it may suggest PW06 exits anti-GBM activity to process cell apoptosis in the human GBM 8401 cells in vitro.

A laparoscopic approach to hysterectomy can significantly reduce patient morbidity and improve the quality of recovery. Subsequent perioperative advances have led to an increasingly shorter hospitalization period following laparoscopic surgery, with the same-day discharge being common. However, due to infrastructural challenges, these shorter times to discharge have mostly been limited to developed countries. To provide a descriptive analysis and evaluate the safety and feasibility of day-case laparoscopic hysterectomy in Trinidad and Tobago. A retrospective analysis of all total laparoscopic hysterectomies over a 3-year period at a secondary medical center in Trinidad and Tobago. The medical records of 154 women who underwent total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) from January 2020 to January 2023 were reviewed. Patient demographics, indications for surgery, perioperative variables, requirements for any additional operative procedures, and perioperative complications were recorded and analyzed. The perioperative management protocol was also outlined. The most common indication for TLH was uterine leiomyoma (45%), followed by endometrial cancer (17.5%). In this study, 96% of patients were discharged satisfactorily within 24 h of surgery, and the mean ± standard deviation (SD) duration of hospitalization was 21 ± 2 h. The mean ± SD surgical time was 91 ± 36 min, and the average estimated blood loss was 93 ± 31 ml. No patients required postoperative blood transfusion. No postoperative opioids were required in 41% of patients, and no perioperative mortality was recorded in this study, with no patients requiring re-operation. Four postoperative complications were noted (2.6%), and this included two patients who developed deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (1.3%), one port-site infection (0.6%), and one case of pulmonary embolism (0.6%). The 30-day readmission rate was 1.9%, and this comprised the patients with DVT and pulmonary embolism. On subgroup analysis, there was no difference in surgical time between patients with body mass index >30 kg/m2, uterine size >12 weeks, and previous abdominal surgery (p > 0.05). Day-case laparoscopic hysterectomy is feasible in a low-resource setting like Trinidad and Tobago. The procedure is safe and associated with a low postoperative complication rate.

This study aimed to explore the function of TNF receptor superfamily member 9 (TNFRSF9) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) by investigating its expression levels and functional implications in PDA cells. TNFRSF9 expression was evaluated in PDA patients, and TNFRSF9 levels were manipulated in PDA cells to assess its effects on cell proliferation, migration, and apoptosis. The downstream target gene PAX6 was also examined. In vivo, studies in nude mice were performed to analyze the impact of TNFRSF9 overexpression on tumor growth. Analysis revealed decreased TNFRSF9 expression in PDA tissues. Ectopic TNFRSF9 expression in PDA cells suppressed cell proliferation and migration and induced apoptosis, while TNFRSF9 knockout showed opposing effects. PAX6 was identified as a downstream target of TNFRSF9. TNFRSF9 overexpression in nude mice led to reduced tumor growth. The study suggests that TNFRSF9 may hold promise as a therapeutic target in PDA management, given its potential to inhibit tumor growth and modulate cell behavior.

For patients with liver cancer, a widespread and lethal tumor on a global scale, chemotherapy and immunotherapy are often the top choices. Paclitaxel, a widely administered chemotherapy drug, faces the dual issues of poor tumor response rates and the rapid onset of chemoresistance. This study delves into the functions of SIRT6 and miR-338-3p in malignancy and paclitaxel resistance of liver cancer cells. Bioinformatics and qRT-PCR were engaged to predict and examine expression profiles of SIRT6 and miR-338-3p in liver cancer tissues and cell lines. A paclitaxel-resistant cell line (MHCC97-PTX) was established for dissecting cellular responses to drug treatment. CCK-8 and colony formation tests measured cell vitality and proliferation, respectively. Flow cytometry assessed apoptotic cell death, and the paclitaxel IC50 values were derived for each group. We utilized online tools to predict miR-338-3p as an upstream regulator of SIRT6, and a dual-luciferase reporter assay verified their direct interaction. SIRT6 is abundantly expressed in liver cancer tissues and cells. SIRT6 knockdown decreased cell vitality and proliferation while promoting apoptosis and paclitaxel sensitivity. miR-338-3p, an upstream regulator of SIRT6 in liver cancer cells, binds to SIRT6 and downregulates its expression, modulating cell malignancy and drug resistance. The duo of miR-338-3p and SIRT6 can drive the aggressiveness and chemoresistance of liver cancer, emerging as hopeful candidates for biomarkers and therapeutic targets.
